# Gas Costs

The first thing you'll notice when attempting to use Ethereum in 2021 is the high fees it costs to make even the simplest transaction on Ethereum.

The reason for this is that Ethereum has so much happening on it and so many users wanting to transact on the chain, 
and it doesn't have the resources to support everyone doing everything they want. 

This problem isn't unique to Ethereum, all chains experience high fees as they gain more users and reach their capacity limits.
