# Solana

## Compliments

### Language Choice

Solana chose Rust as it's core programming language, which is a nice language and already has an active development community. 


## Criticisms

### You must trust the elite

Solana has [insanely high hardware requirements](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs), making it practically impossible to run your own validator at home. 
Because of this you cannot verify the chain yourself and must trust that what the core validators is telling you is true. 
This breaks one of our core beliefs of the decentralized world of "Don't Trust, Verify".

### Centralization

Solana has few validators, and less than 20 can collude to control the network.
Furthermore there is no slashing for bad behavior if they do collude.

The risk of collusion is far more consequential for proof of stake chains vs proof of work, because the entire history can be re-written with ease.
See [PoS Long Range Attack](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/) for more information.

### VC Presale

When Solana was released almost all the initial coins were sold to Venture Capital firms and private investors, the public was excluded.
This gives these firms a lot of control over the network and may lead to replicating the kind of exclusive banking sector we have today.
